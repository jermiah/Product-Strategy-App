       "\"Product: Carotte rapée 250 gr KG\\n\\n--- Product Metrics Summary ---\\n\\nTotal Purchases: 34103\\n\\nTotal Quantity Sold: 37512.0\\n\\nTotal Revenue: €43020.10\\n\\nRepeat Purchase Rate: 26.80%\\n\\nAverage Purchase Frequency: 2.01\\n\\nAverage Share of Wallet: 2.27%\\n\\nAverage Quantity per Purchase: 1.10\\n\\nAverage Revenue per Purchase: €1.26\\n\\nAverage Quantity per Customer: 2.21\\n\\nAverage Revenue per Customer: €2.54\\n\\nMost Used Payment Type: CARD\\n\\nMost Purchased Day Category: Weekday\\n\\nMost Purchased Time of Day: Afternoon\\n\\n--- Product Segmentation & Descriptions ---\\n\\nSales Performance: High-Performance Fast-Moving Products: This group represents products characterized by very high average revenue, large quantities sold, and frequent purchases (high 'Count of Purchases'). These products have minimal 'days since last purchase,' indicating they sell regularly and consistently. They also have significant engagement with promotional activities, evident from high values in both national and store promotions. High standard deviation across these metrics suggests some diversity within this group, indicating both flagship and slightly less consistent but still top-performing products. These products represent essential, high-demand items that strongly drive revenue and volume.\\n\\nCustomer Engagement: Core Revenue Drivers: This cluster features the largest customer base, with the highest 'Number of Customers' indicating broad market appeal and mainstream popularity. It shows stable revenue and quantity metrics—moderate values for 'Avg Revenue,' 'Revenue per Customer,' 'Avg Quantity,' and 'Quantity per Customer'—which point to balanced and steady sales. The repeat engagement is strong, with the highest 'Repeat Purchase Rate' and 'Avg Purchase Frequency' reflecting robust customer loyalty and regular consumption. Although individual spending per transaction is moderate, these products capture a significant share of the customers' wallets due to repeated engagement. They also exhibit high responsiveness to both national and store promotions, and the timing data reveals consistent weekday purchasing with a balanced distribution across morning, afternoon, and evening. Interpretation: These products are central to the store’s portfolio, representing steady and reliable income streams with strong customer loyalty and high promotional effectiveness.\\n\\nPurchase Timing: High Volume, Evening-Dominant, Weekday Preference: This cluster is second-highest in Count_of_Purchases, Total_Quantity, and Total_Revenue, just below the top-performing cluster but well above lower-performing ones. A high Evening_Proportion (~0.5–0.6) indicates that these purchases are heavily concentrated in the evening. The Weekday_vs_Weekend_Ratio is typically around 2, showing a clear tilt toward weekday purchasing but less extreme than the highest volume cluster. These are high-volume transactions occurring mainly in the evenings, still favoring weekdays.\\n\\nPayment Behavior: Mass-Market Hybrid Payment Products: Products here display moderate-to-low revenue per purchase, typical of mass-market or everyday items. They have a mixed payment profile, with a significant share of both card and cash transactions, reflecting a broader customer base. The weekday vs. weekend ratio is relatively balanced, indicating steady demand throughout the week. Key takeaway: These products cater to the mass market, appealing to a diverse set of customers with flexible payment preferences and consistent performance across different days.\\n\\nProduct Type: High-Value & Promotion-Driven Products: This cluster dominates in both total revenue and total quantity sold. The mean revenue (44509.5) and total quantity (17346.7) significantly surpass those of other clusters. It exhibits extremely high promotion sensitivity, with national promotions averaging 906.1 and magasin promotions 1352.0, indicating that these products are frequently sold under promotional offers. Card usage is relatively balanced with cash, though card usage is notably high at around 81%. Customers buy these products frequently (high count of purchases mean: 15154.7), suggesting that these items are staples or highly popular, likely driven by promotional incentives. Additionally, sales show higher proportions in Bron and are consistent throughout both weekdays and weekends.\\n\\nGeographical Segment: Regional Best-Sellers\""

They exhibit moderate revenue and quantities sold, with occasional and steady purchase frequency. Their 'days since last purchase' metric is lower than the slow-moving group, indicating moderate customer interest and consistent replenishment, though not as frequently as the high-performing group. They have moderate responsiveness to promotions, suggesting promotional strategies could positively influence sales. Products in this group represent opportunities for targeted marketing strategies to drive growth, possibly converting them into higher-performing products over time.\\n\\nCustomer Engagement: Low-Engagement, Marginal Products: This cluster has the smallest customer base, with the lowest 'Number of Customers,' which suggests limited appeal and that these products are niche or unpopular. It is characterized by weak revenue and quantity metrics, recording the lowest 'Avg Revenue,' 'Revenue per Customer,' 'Avg Quantity,' and 'Quantity per Customer,' thereby contributing minimally to financial performance. Repeat engagement is poor, as evidenced by the lowest 'Repeat Purchase Rate' and 'Avg Purchase Frequency,' indicating little to no customer loyalty. Additionally, these products capture only a minimal share of the customers' wallets. Their promotional response is limited, reflecting low effectiveness even when discounts or promotions are applied. Timing patterns are not pronounced—with purchases scattered throughout the day and a moderate weekday preference. Interpretation: These products have low engagement and minimal contribution to revenue, suggesting they may need re-evaluation, enhanced marketing efforts, or potential discontinuation based on strategic priorities.\\n\\nPurchase Timing: Low Volume, Balanced Timing, Mixed Weekday-Weekend: This group shows the lowest mean and median for Count_of_Purchases, Total_Quantity, and Total_Revenue among all clusters. The proportions of Morning_Proportion and Evening_Proportion are both moderate (often ~0.4 each), with Afternoon_Proportion around 0.2, indicating no strong single time-of-day dominance. The Weekday_vs_Weekend_Ratio hovers around 1.0, suggesting a near balance between weekday and weekend activity. These are low-volume transactions spread relatively evenly across different times of day and days of the week.\\n\\nPayment Behavior: Consistent Card-Purchased Products: These products show moderate revenue per purchase, reflecting steady, reliable sales performance. Card payments are the primary method, though the ratios are slightly less extreme than in Cluster 0. They exhibit a balanced weekday/weekend ratio, suggesting consistent demand regardless of the day, though with a slight weekday tilt. Key takeaway: These products maintain stable sales through card transactions, representing core offerings with dependable performance.\\n\\nProduct Type: Moderate-Value Regular Essentials: This group represents moderate total revenue (4206.3) and quantity (1212.5), reflecting everyday products that are purchased regularly. They show moderate sensitivity to promotions—with national promotions averaging 133.6 and magasin promotions 127.9—indicating that promotions occasionally drive sales but are not the sole influencer. Card usage remains high at around 87.5%, while cash usage is lower, suggesting a convenience-driven purchasing behavior. The geographical distribution is balanced; however, the lower total revenue indicates these are essential items rather than luxury products. They also display moderate repeat purchase rates and balanced sales across weekdays and weekends.\\n\\nGeographical Segment: Bron-Focused Leaders\",\n",
